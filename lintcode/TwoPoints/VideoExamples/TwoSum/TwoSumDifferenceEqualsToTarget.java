 * Description
   Given an array of integers, find two numbers that their difference equals to a target value.
   where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers 
   (both index1 and index2) are NOT zero-based.
   Notice
   It's guaranteed there is only one available solution

   Example
   Given nums = [2, 7, 15, 24], target = 5
   return [1, 2] (7 - 2 = 5)
