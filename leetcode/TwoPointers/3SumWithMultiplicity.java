Given an integer array A, and an integer target, return the number of tuples i, j, k  such that i < j < k and A[i] + A[j] + A[k] == target.

As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: A = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5], target = 8
Output: 20
Explanation: 
Enumerating by the values (A[i], A[j], A[k]):
(1, 2, 5) occurs 8 times;
(1, 3, 4) occurs 8 times;
(2, 2, 4) occurs 2 times;
(2, 3, 3) occurs 2 times.

Example 2:
Input: A = [1,1,2,2,2,2], target = 5
Output: 12
Explanation: 
A[i] = 1, A[j] = A[k] = 2 occurs 12 times:
We choose one 1 from [1,1] in 2 ways,
and two 2s from [2,2,2,2] in 6 ways.

Constraints:
3 <= A.length <= 3000
0 <= A[i] <= 100
0 <= target <= 300

Think Outside of The Box!
Intuitively, you will try to solve it based on the solution of 3Sum.
But... Build a map for counting different sums of two numbers. The rest of things are straightfoward.

class Solution {
    public int threeSumMulti(int[] A, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        int res = 0;
        int mod = 1000000007;
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
            res = (res + map.getOrDefault(target - A[i], 0)) % mod;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                int temp = A[i] + A[j];
                map.put(temp, map.getOrDefault(temp, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
