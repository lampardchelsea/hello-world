Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Clarification:
Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. 
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. 
It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

Constraints:
0 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in ascending order.

 * Solution
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/solution/
 * Approach #1 (Two Pointers) [Accepted]
   Algorithm
   Since the array is already sorted, we can keep two pointers i and j, where i is the slow-runner 
   while j is the fast-runner. As long as nums[i] = nums[j], we increment j to skip the duplicate.
   When we encounter nums[j]â‰ nums[i], the duplicate run has ended so we must copy its 
   value to nums[i + 1]. i is then incremented and we repeat the same process again until j
   reaches the end of array.
   Complexity analysis
   Time complextiy : O(n). Assume that nn is the length of array. Each of i and j traverses at most n steps.
   Space complexity : O(1).

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Custom Judge:
The judge will test your solution with the following code:
```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
- -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
- nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Solution 1:  Two Pointers (10 min)

Style 1: nums[i++] = nums[j - 1] which always record previous digit
```
class Solution { 
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) { 
        int i = 0; 
        int j = 1; 
        while(j < nums.length) { 
            if(nums[j] != nums[j - 1]) { 
                nums[i++] = nums[j - 1]; 
            } 
            j++; 
        } 
        // Important: To make up the last digit since  
        // "nums[i++] = nums[j - 1]" only record previous 
        // digit when two adjacent digits are different, 
        // it will cause last digit missing record, to fix 
        // just make it up out of the while loop 
        // Test out: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4] 
        // If no such line: output = [0,1,2,3,1,2,2,3,3,4] 
        // expected: nums = [0,1,2,3,4,2,2,3,3,4] 
        nums[i] = nums[j - 1]; 
        return i + 1; 
    } 
}

Time Complexity:O(N), since we only have 2 pointers, and both the pointers will traverse the array at most once. 
Space Complexity:O(1), since we are not using any extra space.
```

Style 2: nums[i++] = nums[j] which always record current digit
```
class Solution { 
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) { 
        int i = 0; 
        int j = 0; 
        while(j < nums.length - 1) { 
            if(nums[j] != nums[j + 1]) { 
                nums[i++] = nums[j]; 
            } 
            j++; 
        } 
        // Make up the last different digit 
        nums[i] = nums[j]; 
        return i + 1; 
    } 
}

Time Complexity:O(N), since we only have 2 pointers, and both the pointers will traverse the array at most once. 
Space Complexity:O(1), since we are not using any extra space.

Overview

The problem would have been simpler if we are allowed to use extra space.
We can create a map which stores all unique array elements as the key and element frequency as the value.
After populating our map, we get all the unique elements from our array.
We then iterate our map and push all the keys in our input array
However, without using extra space it makes it a bit tricky as we have to modify the existing input array


Approach 1: Two indexes approach


Intuition

To solve the problem, let's look at the condition carefully,
	It is guaranteed that the given array is a sorted array.

Let k be the count of unique elements in our input array.
	It doesn't matter what elements we place after the first k elements.

From the condition, we can have a few observations here,
- Since the array we have is sorted, all duplicate values will be one after the other.
- We need to update the first k elements in an array with unique values and return the value of k.

Using the following intuition, let's understand how to address this problem.
- The problem states that we need to fill the first k elements of an array with unique values
- For doing so, we modify the input array in-place so that we don't use extra space
- In order to perform in-place operations, we use the Two indexes approach
- The first index updates the value in our input array while reading the data from the second index
	First Index is responsible for writing unique values in our input array, while Second Index will read the input array and pass all the distinct elements to First Index.
- We continue the above steps until the second index reaches the end of an array


Algorithm

By analyzing the above three key observations, we can derive the following algorithm,
- Start both indexes (insertIndex, i) from 1.
	insertIndex and i represents our First and second Index respectively.
- Check if the previous element is different from the current element
	The previous element is the element just before our i index i.e element present at arr[i-1]
- If found different then perform arr[insertIndex] = arr[i] and increment insertIndex by 1
- Increment i index by 1 till we reach end of the array
  	Note: After reaching the end of the array, our insertIndex variable will hold the count of unique elements in our input array.


```
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int insertIndex = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++){
            // We skip to next index if we see a duplicate element
            if(nums[i - 1] != nums[i]) {
                /* Storing the unique element at insertIndex index and incrementing
                   the insertIndex by 1 */
                nums[insertIndex] = nums[i];     
                insertIndex++;
            }
        }
        return insertIndex;
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis

Let N be the size of the input array.
- Time Complexity: O(N), since we only have 2 pointers, and both the pointers will traverse the array at most once.
- Space Complexity: O(1), since we are not using any extra space.
