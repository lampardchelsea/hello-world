You are given a string s. You can convert s to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it.

Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "aacecaaa"
Output: "aaacecaaa"
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: "dcbabcd"
```

Constraints:
- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- s consists of lowercase English letters only.

Attempt 1: 2023-07-18

Solution 1:  Brute Force (10min, TLE 120/123)
'We can convert it to an alternative problem"find the longest palindrome substring starts from index 0".'
```
class Solution {
    public String shortestPalindrome(String s) {
        // Set as -1 is convenient for no palindrome found and whole
        // string has to be considered as compensation to be added
        // in front of s, work together with s.substring(-1 + 1)
        int cutpoint = -1;
        for(int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if(isPalindrome(s, 0, i)) {
                cutpoint = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        // 'cutpoint + 1' means the substring should start from the 
        // 1st character after cutpoint
        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(s.substring(cutpoint + 1));
        return sb.reverse().toString() + s;
    }
    private boolean isPalindrome(String s, int i, int j) {
        while(i <= j) {
            if(s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
                i++;
                j--;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

Solution 2:  Rolling Hash (360 min)

Wrong Solution
We cannot scan backward as for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) like what we did in Brute Force solution, because not like Brute Force, we can do backward traverse and try to identify a largest i if s[0, i] is a palindrome, if cutpoint 'i' more close to last position, it will find more quickly than scanning forward.
But here is totally different, in Rolling Hash, we have to maintain an iterative way to calculate a 'multiplier' kind of 'forward_hash' as what we did in L1044, we deal with each digit individually, not like Brute Force treat as a substring as s[0, i], e.g if we scan backward, the last digit in "abcd" as 'd' will be treated individually and result is 'd' has same forward & backward hash, then we wrongly update 'cutpoint' from -1 to 3, even "abcd" is not a palindrome at all.
Hence we have to scan from beginning like how we di Rolling Harsh usually, gradually increment a new digit on scanned substring, then calculate a new forward & backward hash
```
class Solution {
    public String shortestPalindrome(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int cutpoint = -1;
        long mod = 1000000007;
        int base = 256;
        long pow = 1;
        long forward_hash = 0;
        long backward_hash = 0;
        for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            forward_hash = (forward_hash * base + s.charAt(i)) % mod;
            backward_hash = (backward_hash + s.charAt(i) * pow) % mod;
            pow = pow * base % mod;
            if(forward_hash == backward_hash) {
                cutpoint = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        return new StringBuilder().append(s.substring(cutpoint)).reverse().append(s).toString();
    }
}
```

Note: Compare to L1044, the Rolling Hash in L214 is more like calculate the 'multipler' in L1044, since we don't need to build a sliding window to find same substring, instead we just need to add one character in each loop iteration forward and backward
```
class Solution {
    public String shortestPalindrome(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int cutpoint = -1;
        long mod = 1000000007;
        int base = 256;
        long pow = 1;
        long forward_hash = 0;
        long backward_hash = 0;
        for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            forward_hash = (forward_hash * base + s.charAt(i)) % mod;
            backward_hash = (backward_hash + s.charAt(i) * pow) % mod;
            pow = pow * base % mod;
            if(forward_hash == backward_hash) {
                cutpoint = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        return new StringBuilder().append(s.substring(cutpoint)).reverse().append(s).toString();
    }
}
```

This problem is indeed computing the longest palindromic prefix of a string s. A naive approach would be computing all the prefixes of s and its reverse, and then finding the longest pair of prefixes that are equal.
Unfortunately, this method requires quadratic time and space since the length sum of all prefixes is 1+2+...+|s| = Î˜(|s|^2).
Via the help of the Rolling Hash method, the above process can be optimized down to linear time. For more details, you can visit here and here.
```
public String shortestPalindrome(String s) {
    int n = s.length(), pos = -1;
    long B = 29, MOD = 1000000007, POW = 1, hash1 = 0, hash2 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++, POW = POW * B % MOD) {
        hash1 = (hash1 * B + s.charAt(i) - 'a' + 1) % MOD;
        hash2 = (hash2 + (s.charAt(i) - 'a' + 1) * POW) % MOD;
        if (hash1 == hash2) pos = i;
    }
    return new StringBuilder().append(s.substring(pos + 1, n)).reverse().append(s).toString();
}
```

Consider a decimal example (base = 10). Say we are given a number 7134. If we read it from left to right, we get 7134. And 4317 if we read it from right to left.

hash1 is the left--to-right fashion:
- hash1 = 0
- hash1 = 0 * 10 + 7 = 7
- hash1 = 7 * 10 + 1 = 71
- hash1 = 71 * 10 + 3 = 713
- hash1 = 713 * 10 + 4 = 7134

hash2 is the right-to-left fashion:
- hash2 = 0
- hash2 = 0 + 7 * 1 = 7
- hash2 = 7 + 1 * 10 = 17
- hash2 = 17 + 3 * 100 = 317
- hash2 = 317 + 4 * 1000 = 4317

A palindrome must be read the same from left to right and from right to left. So in this case, 7134 is not a palindrome.

Above is an example for the decimal case, and for rolling hashing, the only differences are:
1. Base is not 10, but any constant >= 26.
2. hash1 and hash2 are not the exact value, but the exact value modulo a big prime. (Since the exact value is too large to fit in a 32-bit integer.)

As you may notice, the rolling hash function is not an injection, which means that two different strings may share the same hash code.(This is also commonly called a conflict.) But in real, it is very difficult to trigger many conflicts (sometimes not even a single one) unless there are sufficiently many strings given. Therefore, if hash1 is not equal to hash2 for some string, then definitely it is not a palindrome. On the other hand, if they are equal, it means the string is a palindrome with extreme high probability.
