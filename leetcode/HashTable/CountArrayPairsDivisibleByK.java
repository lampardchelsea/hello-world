Given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n and an integer k, return the number of pairs (i, j) such that:
- 0 <= i < j <= n - 1 and
- nums[i] * nums[j] is divisible by k
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: 
The 7 pairs of indices whose corresponding products are divisible by 2 are(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), and (3, 4).
Their products are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20 respectively.
Other pairs such as (0, 2) and (2, 4) have products 3 and 15 respectively, which are not divisible by 2.    

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: There does not exist any pair of indices whose corresponding product is divisible by 5.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i], k <= 10^5

Intuition
Let's first understand this property:
If (a*b)%k == 0, then gcd(a,k) * gcd(b,k) % k is also 0
Letâ€™s assume two numbers 504 and 819. Their prime factorization can be written as:
504 = (2^3) * (3^2) * 7
819 = (3^2) * 7 * 13
Now gcd(504,819) = 63 and 63 = (3^2) * 7
gcd(a,b) is the multiplication of common prime factors of a and b.
Coming back to the statement
How gcd(a,k) * gcd(b,k) % k is 0 ?
For any number to be divisble by k it need to have atleast all the prime factors of k.
gcd(a,k) = Multiplication of all prime factors of k available in a.
and
gcd(b,k) = Multiplication of all prime factors of k available in b.
If gcd(a,k) * gcd(b,k) % k is 0, it means some of the prime factors of k are contributed by a and some of the prime factors of k are contributed by b and thier multiplication has all the prime factors of k which means a*b is divisble by k.
We dont care about prime factors of a or b which are not prime factors of k because they will not help us in making a*b divisible by k.
Example:
Let k=84, a=24, b=273
k = 84 = (2^2) * 3 * 7
a = 24 = (2^3) * 3
b = 273 = 3 * 7 * 13
gcd(a,k) = (2^2) * 3 (Common prime factors of a and k)
gcd(b,k) = 7 * 3 (Common prime factors of b and k)
gcd(a,k) * gcd(b,k) = (2^2) * (3^2) * 7
which has all prime factors of k thus a*b is divisble by k.
Now the solution:
As compared to checking for every pair, if we check for gcd of every number with k then the operations will be less because the number of prime factors of a number will be less.
Code:
typedef long long ll;

class Solution {
public:
    long long countPairs(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<ll, ll> gcdCount;
        ll ans = 0;
        for (ll i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i)
        {
            ll currgcd = __gcd(nums[i], k);
            for (auto &[gc_d, count] : gcdCount)
                if ((currgcd * gc_d) % k == 0)
                    ans += count;
            gcdCount[currgcd]++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

            long currgcd = gcd(nums[i], k);            
            for (HashMap.Entry<Long, Long> entry : gcdCount.entrySet()) {
                long gc_d = entry.getKey();
                long count = entry.getValue();
                if ((currgcd * gc_d) % k == 0) {
                    ans += count;
                }
            }
            gcdCount.put(currgcd, gcdCount.getOrDefault(currgcd, 0L) + 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }

        return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
