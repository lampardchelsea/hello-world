Problem: Design a service like TinyURL, a URL shortening service, a web service that provides short aliases for 
redirection of long URLs.

Solution: If you don't know about TinyURL, just check it. Basically we need a one to one mapping to get shorten 
URL which can retrieve original URL later. This will involve saving such data into database.
We should check the following things:

What's the traffic volume / length of the shortened URL?
What's the mapping function?
Single machine or multiple machines?
Traffic: Let's assume we want to serve more than 1000 billion URLs. If we can use 62 characters [A-Z, a-z, 0-9] for 
the short URLs having length n, then we can have total 62^n URLs. So, we should keep our URLs as short as possible 
given that it should fulfill the requirement. For our requirement, we should use n=7 i.e the length of short URLs 
will be 7 and we can serve 62^7 ~= 3500 billion URLs.

Basic solution:
To make things easier, we can assume the alias is something like http://tinyurl.com/<alias_hash> and alias_hash is 
a fixed length string.

To begin with, let’s store all the mappings in a single database. A straightforward approach is using alias_hash as 
the ID of each mapping, which can be generated as a random string of length 7.

Therefore, we can first just store <ID, URL>. When a user inputs a long URL “http://www.google.com”, the system creates 
a random 7-character string like “abcd123” as ID and inserts entry <“abcd123”, “http://www.google.com”> into the database.

In the run time, when someone visits http://tinyurl.com/abcd123, we look up by ID “abcd123” and redirect to the 
corresponding URL “http://www.google.com”.

Problem with this solution:
We can't generate unique hash values for the given long URL. In hashing, there may be collisions (2 long urls map to same 
short url) and we need a unique short url for every long url so that we can access long url back but hash is one way function.

Better Solution:
One of the most simple but also effective one, is to have a database table set up this way:

Table Tiny_Url(
ID : int PRIMARY_KEY AUTO_INC,
Original_url : varchar,
Short_url : varchar
)

Then the auto-incremental primary key ID is used to do the conversion: (ID, 10) <==> (short_url, BASE). Whenever you insert 
a new original_url, the query can return the new inserted ID, and use it to derive the short_url, save this short_url and 
send it to cilent.

Code for methods (that are used to convert ID to short_url and short_url to ID):

string idToShortURL(long int n)
{
    // Map to store 62 possible characters
    char map[] = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEF"
                 "GHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789";
  
    string shorturl;
  
    // Convert given integer id to a base 62 number
    while (n)
    {
        shorturl.push_back(map[n%62]);
        n = n/62;
    }
  
    // Reverse shortURL to complete base conversion
    reverse(shorturl.begin(), shorturl.end());
  
    return shorturl;
}
  
// Function to get integer ID back from a short url
long int shortURLtoID(string shortURL)
{
    long int id = 0; // initialize result
  
    // A simple base conversion logic
    for (int i=0; i < shortURL.length(); i++)
    {
        if ('a' <= shortURL[i] && shortURL[i] <= 'z')
          id = id*62 + shortURL[i] - 'a';
        if ('A' <= shortURL[i] && shortURL[i] <= 'Z')
          id = id*62 + shortURL[i] - 'A' + 26;
        if ('0' <= shortURL[i] && shortURL[i] <= '9')
          id = id*62 + shortURL[i] - '0' + 52;
    }
    return id;
}

Multiple machines:
If we are dealing with massive data of our service, distributed storage can increase our capacity. The idea is simple,
get a hash code from original URL and go to corresponding machine then use the same process as a single machine. For 
routing to the correct node in cluster, Consistent Hashing is commonly used.

Following is the pseudo code for example,
Get shortened URL
hash original URL string to 2 digits as hashed value hash_val
use hash_val to locate machine on the ring
insert original URL into the database and use getShortURL function to get shortened URL short_url
Combine hash_val and short_url as our final_short_url (length=8) and return to the user

Retrieve original from short URL
get first two chars in final_short_url as hash_val
use hash_val to locate the machine
find the row in the table by rest of 6 chars in final_short_url as short_url
return original_url to the user

Other factors:
One thing I’d like to further discuss here is that by using GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) as the entry ID, what 
would be pros/cons versus incremental ID in this problem?

If you dig into the insert/query process, you will notice that using random string as IDs may sacrifice performance a 
little bit. More specifically, when you already have millions of records, insertion can be costly. Since IDs are not 
sequential, so every time a new record is inserted, the database needs to go look at the correct page for this ID. 
However, when using incremental IDs, insertion can be much easier – just go to the last page.

Assign Unique Integer Id and Convert it to base-62

A better idea is to assign a unique integer id to each long URL representation and convert this integer id to its base-62 representation.

A URL character can be one of the following

Lower case alphabet [a to z], total 26 characters
Upper case alphabet [A to Z], total 26 characters
Digit [0 to 9], total 10 characters
So there are total 26 + 26 + 10 = 62 possible characters and hence the task is to convert a decimal number to base 62 number.

To get the original long URL, we need to get URL stored in the Map.

Time complexity: O(log n) for encode() method and O(1) for decode() method. To covert decimal integer id n to its base-62 representation will take O(log62(n)) time.
Space complexity: O(m) - where m is the number of entries in the HashMap. i.e., the number of shortURLs generated so far.

class Codec
{
	static final String BASE_HOST = "http://tinyurl.com/";
	static final Map<String, String> shortToLongMap = new HashMap<>();
    static final Map<String, String> longToShortMap = new HashMap<>();
    static int counter = 0;

    // Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
    public String encode(String longUrl)
	{
        if(longToShortMap.containsKey(longUrl))
            return longToShortMap.get(longUrl);
        
        String shortUrl = BASE_HOST + convertDecimalToBase62(counter++);
        shortToLongMap.put(shortUrl, longUrl);
        longToShortMap.put(longUrl, shortUrl);
        return shortUrl;
    }

    // Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
    public String decode(String shortUrl)
	{
        return shortToLongMap.get(shortUrl);
    }
    
    private String convertDecimalToBase62(int n)
    {
        final char[] BASE62 = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789".toCharArray();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        
		while(n > 0)
		{
            sb.append(BASE62[n % 62]);
            n /= 62;
        }
        return sb.reverse().toString();
    }
}
