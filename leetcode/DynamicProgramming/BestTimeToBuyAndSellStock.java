/**
 Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one 
share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

/**
 The logic to solve this problem is same as "max subarray problem" using Kadane's Algorithm. 
 Since no body has mentioned this so far, I thought it's a good thing for everybody to know.

All the straight forward solution should work, but if the interviewer twists the question 
slightly by giving the difference array of prices, Ex: for {1, 7, 4, 11}, if he gives 
{0, 6, -3, 7}, you might end up being confused.

Here, the logic is to calculate the difference (maxCur += prices[i] - prices[i-1]) of the 
original array, and find a contiguous subarray giving maximum profit. If the difference falls 
below 0, reset it to zero.

*maxCur = current maximum value
*maxSoFar = maximum value found so far

A more clear explanation on why sum of subarray works.:

Suppose we have original array:
[a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6]

what we are given here(or we calculate ourselves) is:
[b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6]

where,
b[i] = 0, when i == 0
b[i] = a[i] - a[i - 1], when i != 0

suppose if a2 and a6 are the points that give us the max difference (a2 < a6)
then in our given array, we need to find the sum of sub array from b3 to b6.

b3 = a3 - a2
b4 = a4 - a3
b5 = a5 - a4
b6 = a6 - a5

adding all these, all the middle terms will cancel out except two
i.e.

b3 + b4 + b5 + b6 = a6 - a2

a6 - a2 is the required solution.

so we need to find the largest sub array sum to get the most profit

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Constraints:
- 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4

Say the given array is:
[7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
If we plot the numbers of the given array on a graph, we get:


The points of interest are the peaks and valleys in the given graph. We need to find the largest price following each valley, which difference could be the max profit. We can maintain two variables - minprice and maxprofit corresponding to the smallest valley and maximum profit (maximum difference between selling price and minprice) obtained so far respectively.
