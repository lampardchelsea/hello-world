Approach 1: Recursive Dynamic Programming


Intuition

If you are new to Dynamic Programming, please see our Leetcode Explore Card for more information on it!

An intuitive approach to solve this problem is to generate all the subsequences of the given string and find the longest palindromic string among all the generated strings. There are a total of 2^n strings possible, where n denotes the length of the given string. We can use recursion to generate all possible strings.

If the first and last characters are the same, both characters are guaranteed to be considered in the final palindrome. As a result, we add 2 to our answer variable and recursively remove the first and last characters from the remaining substring.

If the first and last characters arenâ€™t the same, they cannot both occur in the final palindrome. As a result, we recurse over the substring removing the first and also recurse over the substring removing the last character. As we want the longest palindromic subsequence, we pick the maximum out of both of these.

To perform this recursion, we use two pointers, i and j, where i is the index of the first character and j is the index of the last character, to form a substring of s that is being considered. As a result, the recursive relation can be written as follows:
```
1. If s[i] == s[j], perform answer = 2 + LPS(i + 1, j - 1). 
2. Else, perform answer = max(LPS(i, j - 1), LPS(i + 1, j).
```
where LPS(int i, int j)is a recursive method that returns the longest palindromic subsequence of the substring formed from index i to index j in s. The solution is LPS(0, n - 1), where nis the length of s

The recursion tree of the above relation would look something like this:

Several subproblems, such as LPS(2, n - 2), LPS(1, n - 3), etc., are solved twice in the partial recursion tree shown above. If we draw the entire recursion tree, we can see that there are many subproblems that are solved repeatedly.

To avoid this issue, we store the solution of the subproblem in a 2D array when it is solved. When we encounter the same subproblem again, we simply refer to the array. This is called memoization.


Algorithm

1. Create an integer variable n and initialize it to the size of s.
2. Create a 2D-array called memo having n rows and n columns where memo[i][j] contains the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of the substring formed from index i to j in s.
3. Return lps(s, 0, n - 1, memo) where lps is a recursive method with four parameters: s, the starting index of the substring under consideration as i, the ending index of the substring as j and memo. We perform the following in this method:
	- If memo[i][j] != 0, it indicates that we have already solved this subproblem, so we return memo[i][j].
	- If i > j, the string is empty. We return 0.
	- If i == j, it is a substring having one character. As a result, we return 1.
	- If the first and the last characters are the same, i.e., s[i] == s[j], we include these two characters in the palindromic subsequence and add it to the longest palindromic subsequence formed using the substring from index i + 1 to j - 1 (inclusive). We perform memo[i][j] = lps(s, i + 1, j - 1, memo) + 2.
	- Otherwise, if the first and the last characters do not match, we recursively search for the longest palindromic subsequence in both the substrings formed after ignoring the first and last characters. We pick the maximum of these two. We perform memo[i][j] = max(lps(s, i + 1, j, memo), lps(s, i, j - 1, memo)).
	- Return memo[i][j].


Implementation

```
class Solution {
    public int longestPalindromeSubseq(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[][] memo = new int[n][n];
        return lps(s, 0, n - 1, memo);
    }



    private int lps(String s, int i, int j, int[][] memo) {
        if (memo[i][j] != 0) {
            return memo[i][j];
        }
        if (i > j) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (i == j) {
            return 1;
        }

        if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
            memo[i][j] = lps(s, i + 1, j - 1, memo) + 2;
        } else {
            memo[i][j] = Math.max(lps(s, i + 1, j, memo), lps(s, i, j - 1, memo));
        }
        return memo[i][j];
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis

Here, n is the length of s.
- Time complexity: O(n^2)
	- Initializing the memo array takes O(n^2) time.
	- Since there are O(n^2)states that we need to iterate over, the recursive function is called O(n^2) times.
- Space complexity: O(n^2)
	- The memo array consumes O(n^2) space.
	- The recursion stack used in the solution can grow to a maximum size of O(n). When we try to form the recursion tree, we see that there are maximum of two branches that can be formed at each level (when s[i]!= s[j]). The recursion stack would only have one call out of the two branches. The height of such a tree will be O(n) because at each level we are decrementing the length of the string under consideration by '1'. As a result, the recursion tree that will be formed will have O(n) height. Hence, the recursion stack will have a maximum of O(n) elements.

Approach 2: Iterative Dynamic Programming


Intuition

We used memoization in the preceding approach to store the answers to subproblems in order to solve a larger problem. We can also use a bottom-up approach to solve such problems without using recursion. We build answers to subproblems iteratively first, then use them to build answers to larger problems.

Using the same method as before, we create a 2D-array dp, where dp[i][j] contains the answer of the longest palindromic subsequence of the substring formed from index i to j in s. Our answer would be dp[0][n - 1], where n is the size of s. The state transition would be as follows:
```
1. If s[i] == s[j], perform dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i + 1][j - 1]. 
2. Otherwise, perform dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i + 1][j].
```

The dp array can be filled in a variety of ways. A few of them are briefly discussed below:
- Building from smaller to larger strings: We can begin by selecting all possible substrings of length '1', then find the largest palindromic subsequence in all substrings of length '2', then in length '3', and so on to obtain the answer for the entire string.
- Using two pointers: We can use two pointers, i and j, where i points to the first character of the substring under consideration and j points to the last character. Using dp entries corresponding to all the substrings formed by selecting indices within the range from i to j (inclusive), we form answers for all the substrings that start index i - 1. The pointer j moves from j = i - 1 to j = n - 1 to cover all possible substrings that start at index i - 1. (we can also choose to move from i to j + 1, i.e., from left to right). From the end of the string, we move from right to left, decrementing i by 1 until we reach the index 0. This is the approach we take here.

Algorithm

1. Create an integer variable n and initialize it to the size of s.
2. Create a 2D-array called dp having n rows and n columns where dp[i][j] contains the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of the substring formed from index i to j in s.
3. We iterate using two loops. The outer loop iterates from i = n - 1 to i = 0 decrementing i by 1 after each iteration. At the end of each iteration, we will have the length of longest palindromic subsequence in all the substrings that start from index i in s. For each i, we first mark dp[i][i] = 1 because it denotes just one character and then we iterate over j = i + 1 to j = n - 1 and perform the following:
	- If the first and the last characters are the same, i.e., s[i] == s[j], we include these two characters in the palindromic subsequence and add it to the longest palindromic subsequence formed using the substring from index i + 1 to j - 1 (inclusive). We perform dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2. We already have the answer for dp[i + 1][j - 1] because we computed it for substrings starting at index i + 1 in the previous iteration of outer loop.
	- Otherwise, if the first and the last characters do not match, we look for the longest palindromic subsequence in both the substrings formed after ignoring the first and last characters. We pick the maximum of these two. We perform dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]).
4. Return dp[0][n - 1].

Implementation

```
class Solution {
    public int longestPalindromeSubseq(String s) {
        int[][] dp = new int[s.length()][s.length()];

        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            dp[i][i] = 1;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < s.length(); j++) {
                if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[0][s.length() - 1];
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis

Here, n is the length of s.
- Time complexity: O(n^2)
	- Initializing the dp array takes O(n^2)time.
	- We fill the dp array which takes O(n^2)time.
- Space complexity: O(n^2)
	- The dp array consumes O(n^2)space.

Approach 3: Dynamic Programming with Space Optimization


Intuition

The state transition, as we discussed in previous approaches, is:
```
1. If s[i] == s[j], perform dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i + 1][j - 1]. 
2. Otherwise, perform dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i + 1][j].

If we look closely at this transition, to fill dp[i][j] for a particular i and all possible values of j, we only need the values from the current and previous rows. To fill row i + 1 in the dp grid, we need the values from row i + 1(dp[i + 1][j - 1]) and previously computed value in the ith row itself (dp[i][j - 1]). Values in rows i + 2, i + 3, and so on are no longer needed.
Our task is complete if we can store the values of the previous iteration, i.e., for row i + 1 after each iteration of the outer loop.

We can solve this by using two 1D arrays of size n, dp and dpPrev, where nis the size of s. We repeat the previous approach by running two loops. The outer loop runs from i = n - 1to i = 0, and the inner loop runs from j = i + 1 to j = n - 1.

Now, dp[j] stores the length of longest palindromic subsequence of the substring from index i to j in s. It is similar to what dp[i][j] stored in previous approach.

The other array dpPrev is important to understand. It helps us by remembering the previous state that we completed previously. dpPrev[j] stores the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of the substring from index i + 1 to j in s. It is analogous to dp[i + 1][j] in the previous approach.

Because dpPrev stores the answers of substrings beginning with index i + 1 and dp stores the answers of substrings beginning with index i we must copy the elements of dp to dpPrev after iterating over all the substrings beginning with index i to prepare for the next iteration. After we copy dp to dpPrev, for the next iteration which considers substrings from i - 1, dpPrev will hold values of substrings beginning at index i which is exactly what we want.


Algorithm

1. Create an integer variable n and initialize it to the size of s.
2. Create two arrays called dp and dpPrev of size n.
3. We iterate using two loops with outer loop running from i = n - 1 to i = 0 decrementing i by 1after each iteration. For each i, we first mark dp[i] = 1since it denotes just one character at index i and then we iterate over j = i + 1to j = n - 1and perform the following:
	- If the first and the last characters are the same, i.e., s[i] == s[j], we include these two characters in the palindromic subsequence and add it to the longest palindromic subsequence formed using the substring from index i + 1to j - 1(inclusive). We perform dp[j] = dpPrev[j - 1] + 2. Note that we already have computed answer for substrings starting from index i + 1in the previous iteration of outer loop. We have it in dpPrev.
	- Otherwise, if the first and the last characters do not match, we check for the longest palindromic subsequence in both the substrings formed after ignoring the first and last characters. We pick the maximum of these two. We perform dp[j] = max(dpPrev[j], dp[j - 1]).
	- After the completion of inner loop, we copy dp to dpPrev.
4. Return dp[n - 1](or dpPrev[n - 1]as both are similar).

Implementation

```
class Solution {
    public int longestPalindromeSubseq(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        int[] dpPrev = new int[n];

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            dp[i] = 1;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
                    dp[j] = dpPrev[j - 1] + 2;
                } else {
                    dp[j] = Math.max(dpPrev[j], dp[j - 1]);
                }
            }
            dpPrev = dp.clone();
        }

        return dp[n - 1];
    }
}
```

Complexity Analysis

Here, n is the length of s.
- Time complexity: O(n^2)
	- Initializing the dp and dpPrev arrays take O(n) time.
	- To get the answer, we use two loops that take O(n^2) time.
- Space complexity: O(n)
	- The dp and dpPrev arrays take O(n) space each.
