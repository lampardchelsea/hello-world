 Given a knapsack weight W and a set of n items with certain value val[i] and weight wt[i], 
 we need to calculate minimum amount that could make up this quantity exactly.  
 This is different from classical Knapsack problem, here we are allowed to use 
 unlimited number of instances of an item.
 Examples:

Input : W = 100
       val[]  = {1, 30}
       wt[] = {1, 50}
Output : 100
There are many ways to fill knapsack.
1) 2 instances of 50 unit weight item.
2) 100 instances of 1 unit weight item.
3) 1 instance of 50 unit weight item and 50
   instances of 1 unit weight items.
We get maximum value with option 2.

Input : W = 8
       val[] = {10, 40, 50, 70}
       wt[]  = {1, 3, 4, 5}       
Output : 110 
We get maximum value with one unit of
weight 5 and one unit of weight 3.

Its an unbounded knapsack problem as we can use 1 or more instances of any resource. 
A simple 1D array, say dp[W+1] can be used such that dp[i] stores the maximum value 
which can achieved using all items and i capacity of knapsack. Note that we use 1D 
array here which is different from classical knapsack where we used 2D array. Here 
number of items never changes. We always have all items available.

We can recursively compute dp[] using below formula
i is capacity of knapsack
dp[i] = 0
dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-wt[j]] + val[j]) 
                   where j varies from 0 to n-1 such that: wt[j] <= i
result = d[W]

// Solution 1:

// Java program to find maximum achievable 
// value with a knapsack of weight target and 
// multiple instances allowed. 
class Solution {
    // Returns the maximum value with knapsack of target capacity 
    private int unboundedKnapsack(int target, int n, int[] val, int[] weight) {
        // dp[i] is going to store maximum value with knapsack capacity i. 
        int dp[] = new int[target + 1];
        // Fill dp[] using above recursive formula 
        for (int i = 0; i <= target; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (weight[j] <= i) {
                    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[i - weight[j]] + val[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[target];
    }
}
