 * Refer to

 * On a staircase, the i-th step has some non-negative cost cost[i] assigned (0 indexed).

    Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. You need to find minimum cost 
    to reach the top of the floor, and you can either start from the step with index 0, or the 
    step with index 1.

    Example 1:
    Input: cost = [10, 15, 20]
    Output: 15
    Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[1], pay that cost and go to the top.
    Example 2:
    Input: cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping cost[3].
    Note:
    cost will have a length in the range [2, 1000].
    Every cost[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 999]

/**
Problem list: https://leetcode.com/list/55ac4kuc

Generate problem statement for this pattern

Statement
Given a target find minimum (maximum) cost / path / sum to reach the target.

Approach
Choose minimum (maximum) path among all possible paths before the current state, then add value for the current state.

routes[i] = min(routes[i-1], routes[i-2], ... , routes[i-k]) + cost[i]
Generate optimal solutions for all values in the target and return the value for the target.

Top-Down
for (int j = 0; j < ways.size(); ++j) {
    result = min(result, topDown(target - ways[j]) + cost/ path / sum);
}
return memo[state parameters] = result;

Bottom-Up
for (int i = 1; i <= target; ++i) {
   for (int j = 0; j < ways.size(); ++j) {
       if (ways[j] <= i) {
           dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - ways[j]] + cost / path / sum) ;
       }
   }
}

return dp[target]
