// Unbounded knapsack

/**
 * Refer to
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/description/
 * You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. 
   Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up 
   that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of 
   the coins, return -1.
    Example 1:
    coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
    return 3 (11 = 5 + 5 + 1)
    Example 2:
    coins = [2], amount = 3
    return -1.
    Note:
    You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

/**
A recursive solution to the unbounded knapsack problem
Observation:
I can never exhaust any item because there are an unbounded supply of items.
Therefore:
The technique used in the 0,1 knapsack problem cannot be used.

Caveat:
You can only pack the item k into the knapsack if:
      W â‰¥ wi  !!!
      
Base case(s) in the unbounded knapsack problem
Base case:
When the knapsack is full, you cannot pack any item into the knapsack
Therefore, the total value of a 0 capacity knapsack = 0

In other words:
    M(v, w, 0) = 0;   (can't packet anything into a 0-capacity knapsack)
