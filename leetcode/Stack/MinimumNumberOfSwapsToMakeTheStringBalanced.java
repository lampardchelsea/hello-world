https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-swaps-to-make-the-string-balanced/description/
You are given a 0-indexed string s of even length n. The string consists of exactly n / 2 opening brackets '[' and n / 2 closing brackets ']'.
A string is called balanced if and only if:
- It is the empty string, or
- It can be written as AB, where both A and B are balanced strings, or
- It can be written as [C], where C is a balanced string.
You may swap the brackets at any two indices any number of times.
Return the minimum number of swaps to make s balanced.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "][]["
Output: 1
Explanation: You can make the string balanced by swapping index 0 with index 3.
The resulting string is "[[]]".

Example 2:
Input: s = "]]][[["
Output: 2
Explanation: You can do the following to make the string balanced:
- Swap index 0 with index 4. s = "[]][][".
- Swap index 1 with index 5. s = "[[][]]".
The resulting string is "[[][]]".

Example 3:
Input: s = "[]"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string is already balanced.
 
Constraints:
- n == s.length
- 2 <= n <= 106
- n is even.
- s[i] is either '[' or ']'.
- The number of opening brackets '[' equals n / 2, and the number of closing brackets ']' equals n / 2.

Problem Summary
Given a string s consisting only of '[' and ']', find the minimum number of swaps needed to make the string balanced. A balanced string has every '[' matched with a ']' in the correct order.
Approach
1.Greedy Counting:
- Traverse the string while keeping track of unmatched '[' brackets.
- When encountering an unmatched ']', it indicates an imbalance. We can fix this by swapping it with a later '['.
- The number of such imbalances divided by 2 gives the minimum swaps needed.
2.Key Insight:
- Each swap fixes two imbalances (one ']' and one '['), so the number of swaps is ceil(unmatched / 2).
Solution Code
class Solution {
    public int minSwaps(String s) {
        int unmatched = 0;
        int swaps = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '[') {
                unmatched++;
            } else {
                if (unmatched > 0) {
                    unmatched--; // Matches with a previous '['
                } else {
                    swaps++; // Needs a swap
                }
            }
        }
        return (swaps + 1) / 2; // Equivalent to ceil(unmatched / 2)
    }
}
Explanation
1.Initialization:
- unmatched counts the number of unmatched '[' brackets.
- swaps counts the number of required swaps.
2.Traversal:
- For each '[', increment unmatched.
- For each ']':

- If there's an unmatched '[', decrement unmatched (they form a pair).
- Otherwise, increment swaps (this ']' needs to be swapped).
3.Result Calculation:
- Each swap fixes two imbalances, so the minimum swaps is (swaps + 1) / 2 (equivalent to rounding up swaps / 2).
Example
- Input: s = "]]][[["
- Traversal:

- ']' â†’ swaps = 1
- ']' â†’ swaps = 2
- ']' â†’ swaps = 3
- '[' â†’ unmatched = 1
- '[' â†’ unmatched = 2
- '[' â†’ unmatched = 3
- swaps = 3, so result is (3 + 1) / 2 = 2.
Time and Space Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string (single pass).
- Space Complexity: O(1), using only a few extra variables.
Alternative Approach (Stack-Based)
A stack can also be used to count unmatched brackets, but the greedy approach is more efficient for this problem.
Final Notes
- The greedy method is optimal for this problem.
- The key is recognizing that each swap fixes two imbalances, leading to the formula (swaps + 1) / 2.
This solution efficiently computes the minimum swaps by leveraging simple counting and arithmetic.

Show me stack based approach
Intuition
The problem requires balancing a string of brackets ('[' and ']') with the minimum number of swaps. A stack can help track unmatched brackets efficiently. Hereâ€™s the idea:
1.Use a stack to match '[' and ']' as we traverse the string.
2.Count unmatched ']' that cannot be matched with a '[' in the stack.
3.Each swap fixes two unmatched brackets, so the minimum swaps is ceil(unmatched / 2).
Algorithm
1.Initialize a stack and a counter for unmatched ']'.
2.Traverse the string:
- Push '[' onto the stack.
- For ']', pop from the stack if possible (matching '['). Otherwise, increment the unmatched counter.
3.The number of swaps needed is (unmatched + 1) / 2.
Solution Code (Stack-Based)
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public int minSwaps(String s) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        int unmatchedClosing = 0;

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '[') {
                stack.push(c);
            } else {
                if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                    stack.pop(); // Match with a '['
                } else {
                    unmatchedClosing++; // No matching '[', needs swap
                }
            }
        }
        return (unmatchedClosing + 1) / 2;
    }
}

Explanation
1.Stack Initialization:
- stack keeps track of unmatched '['.
- unmatchedClosing counts ']' that couldnâ€™t be matched.
2.Traversal:
- '[': Push onto the stack (waiting for a ']').
- ']':

- If the stack is not empty, pop a '[' (they form a pair).
- If the stack is empty, increment unmatchedClosing (this ']' needs a swap).
3.Result Calculation:
- Each swap fixes two unmatched ']', so the minimum swaps is (unmatchedClosing + 1) / 2 (equivalent to rounding up unmatchedClosing / 2).
Example
- Input: s = "]]][[["
- Traversal:

- ']' â†’ unmatchedClosing = 1 (stack is empty).
- ']' â†’ unmatchedClosing = 2.
- ']' â†’ unmatchedClosing = 3.
- '[' â†’ pushed to stack (stack = ['[']).
- '[' â†’ pushed to stack (stack = ['[', '[']).
- '[' â†’ pushed to stack (stack = ['[', '[', '[']).
- unmatchedClosing = 3 â†’ Swaps needed = (3 + 1) / 2 = 2.
Time & Space Complexity
- Time: O(n) (single pass over the string).
- Space: O(n) (stack can grow up to n/2 in the worst case).
Comparison with Greedy Approach
ApproachTimeSpaceKey IdeaGreedyO(n)O(1)Count unmatched ']' directly.StackO(n)O(n)Explicitly track unmatched '[' with a stack.
When to Use Which?
- Greedy is more efficient (no extra space).
- Stack is more intuitive for those familiar with bracket-matching problems.
Final Notes
- The stack approach is clear and easy to understand, but the greedy method is optimal for this problem.
- Both approaches yield the same result, but the greedy one is preferred in interviews for efficiency.
