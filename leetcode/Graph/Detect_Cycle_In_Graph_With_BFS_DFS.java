 1. Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph using BFS
 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph-using-bfs/
 
 The idea is to simply use Kahnâ€™s algorithm for Topological Sorting
 Steps involved in detecting cycle in a directed graph using BFS.
 Step-1: Compute in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex present in the 
         graph and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.
 Step-2: Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a queue (Enqueue operation)
 Step-3: Remove a vertex from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then.
         Increment count of visited nodes by 1.
         Decrease in-degree by 1 for all its neighboring nodes.
         If in-degree of a neighboring nodes is reduced to zero, then add it to the queue. 
 Step 4: Repeat Step 3 until the queue is empty.
 Step 5: If count of visited nodes is not equal to the number of nodes in the graph has cycle, otherwise not.
 
 How to find in-degree of each node?
 There are 2 ways to calculate in-degree of every vertex:
 Take an in-degree array which will keep track of
 
 1) Traverse the array of edges and simply increase the counter of the destination node by 1.
    for each node in Nodes
        indegree[node] = 0;
    for each edge(src,dest) in Edges
        indegree[dest]++
  Time Complexity: O(V+E)
 
 2) Traverse the list for every node and then increment the in-degree of all the nodes connected to it by 1.
    for each node in Nodes
        If (list[node].size()!=0) then
        for each dest in list
            indegree[dest]++;
  Time Complexity: The outer for loop will be executed V number of times and the inner for loop will be 
  executed E number of times, Thus overall time complexity is O(V+E).

  The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(V+E)
  
  Actually BFS implement on this way is Toplogical Sort, examples on below problems:
