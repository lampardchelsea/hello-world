 https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal/
 Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]
Return the following binary tree:

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
