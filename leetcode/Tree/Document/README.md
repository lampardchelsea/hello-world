Solve Tree Problem Guidelines:
1. Find relationship or changes what should happen on 1 node (or smallest group which construct by a root with its left / right child)

2. If try to solve with recursive, find which kind of traverse we suppose to use, for example, pre-order traverse able to store nodes from top-down (e.g 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor), post-order traverse able to store nodes from bottom-up (e.g 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum). If try to solve with iterative, find which template we try to use (https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/discuss/45621/preorder-inorder-and-postorder-traversal-iterative-java-solution)
