Solve Tree Problem Guidelines:
1. Find relationship or changes what should happen on 1 node (or smallest group which construct by a root with its left / right child)
2. Find which kind of traverse we suppose to use, for example, pre-order traverse able to store nodes from top-down (e.g 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor), post-order traverse able to store nodes from bottom-up (e.g 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum).
