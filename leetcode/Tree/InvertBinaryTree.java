/**
 *  * Approach #1 (Recursive) [Accepted]
 * This is a classic tree problem that is best-suited for a recursive approach.
 * Algorithm
 * The inverse of an empty tree is the empty tree. The inverse of a tree with root r, and subtrees right
 * and left, is a tree with root r, whose right subtree is the inverse of left, and whose left subtree 
 * is the inverse of right

		public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
		    if (root == null) {
		        return null;
		    }
		    TreeNode right = invertTree(root.right);
		    TreeNode left = invertTree(root.left);
		    root.left = right;
		    root.right = left;
		    return root;
		}

  * Complexity Analysis
  * Since each node in the tree is visited only once, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of 
  * nodes in the tree. We cannot do better than that, since at the very least we have to visit each node 
  * to invert it.
  * Because of recursion, O(h) function calls will be placed on the stack in the worst case, where h is 
  * the height of the tree. Because hEO(n), the space complexity is O(n).
  * 
  * Approach #2 (Iterative) [Accepted]
  * Alternatively, we can solve the problem iteratively, in a manner similar to breadth-first search.
  * Algorithm
  * The idea is that we need to swap the left and right child of all nodes in the tree. So we create a queue 
  * to store nodes whose left and right child have not been swapped yet. Initially, only the root is in the 
  * queue. As long as the queue is not empty, remove the next node from the queue, swap its children, 
  * and add the children to the queue. Null nodes are not added to the queue. Eventually, the queue will 
  * be empty and all the children swapped, and we return the original root.

		public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
		    if (root == null) return null;
		    Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
		    queue.add(root);
		    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
		        TreeNode current = queue.poll();
		        TreeNode temp = current.left;
		        current.left = current.right;
		        current.right = temp;
		        if (current.left != null) queue.add(current.left);
		        if (current.right != null) queue.add(current.right);
		    }
		    return root;
		}

  * Complexity Analysis
  * Since each node in the tree is visited / added to the queue only once, the time complexity is O(n), where 
  * n is the number of nodes in the tree.
  * Space complexity is O(n), since in the worst case, the queue will contain all nodes in one level of the 
  * binary tree. For a full binary tree, the leaf level has ceiling (n/2) leaves.
