 For a binary tree T, we can define a flip operation as follows: choose any node, and 
 swap the left and right child subtrees.

A binary tree X is flip equivalent to a binary tree Y if and only if we can make X equal 
to Y after some number of flip operations.

Write a function that determines whether two binary trees are flip equivalent.  The trees 
are given by root nodes root1 and root2.

Example 1:
Input: root1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8], root2 = [1,3,2,null,6,4,5,null,null,null,null,8,7]
Output: true
Explanation: We flipped at nodes with values 1, 3, and 5.
                1                          1
          2          3                3         2    
       4    5      6                    6     4    5
          7   8                                  8   7
Note:
Each tree will have at most 100 nodes.
Each value in each tree will be a unique integer in the range [0, 99]

/**
 Update:
For some time, I forgot the following constraint and changed the comlexity from O(n) to O(n ^ 2):
Each value in each tree will be a unique integer in the range [0, 99]

The follows are correct only without the above condition.
Complexity analysis corrected from O(n) to O(n ^ 2), credit to @coder_coder.
Analysis:

In worst case, the recursion corresponds to a perfect quaternary (means 4-nary) tree, which 
has 4 ^ d = N ^ 2 nodes, and we have to traverse all nodes. d = logN is the depth of the binary tree.

One worst case for input:
two perfect binary trees: root1 & root2.

Root1's nodes are all 0s;
Root2's nodes are all 0s, with the exception that left and right bottoms are both 1s.
Time & Space: O(n ^ 2).
